I want to give a talk about creating things that aren't code from AI.

## Introduction: 3 Examples

1. Dad's workout video.
The key part is that I used agentic to create a Python script that created an MPeg video.

2. Creating the flowchart with Jacqueline.
The key part is that I'm using AI to iteratively build a Mermaid diagram for a very complicated flowchart that I could never create by hand.

3. Creating the SVG for spoons.
The idea is that I can do the same process to create diagrams in my slides that render.
This allows me to create stuff.

## Talk Structure

Start with the importance of journaling.
Then talk about using journaling at the retreat and what it created.
Then talk about using the interview process to do my daily statuses.
Then talk about: do you vomit or do you interview?
In the end, there's maybe a bit of both.
Interviews lead to vomit and vomit leads to interviews.

But all of this creates core data.
That data can then be analyzed as an individual coach for so many different purposes: blogs, daily status, images, weaknesses, strengths, blind spots, patterns.
There are so many different ways a coach would look at any given thing and help you.
Now you have this raw data to get there.

I also want to talk about creating the document that outlines how to do the builder pattern.
And I want to talk about using AI for naming.
That's really powerful as well.

## Patterns to Introduce

I'm going to need to introduce a bunch of patterns so that people can understand:
- Interview and vomit pattern
- Checkpoints
- Knowledge documents
- Reverse direction
- Cast wide / multiple solutions
- Iterative process

Other concepts. Building a second brain. Capture, distill, whatever that pattern is. Clean language. Iterative. AI as an NPC or non-playing character. People as an NPC.
